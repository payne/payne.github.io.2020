[Spring Boot Persistence Best Practices: Optimize Java Persistence Performance in Spring Boot Applications](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/spring-boot-persistence/9781484256268/)
by [Anghel Leonard](https://learning.oreilly.com/search/?query=author%3A%22Anghel%20Leonard%22&extended_publisher_data=true&highlight=true&include_assessments=false&include_case_studies=true&include_courses=true&include_playlists=true&include_collections=true&include_notebooks=true&is_academic_institution_account=false&source=user&sort=relevance&facet_json=true&page=0&include_facets=false&include_scenarios=true&include_sandboxes=true&json_facets=true) 
is handy because I can wonder into the ebook and quickly get concrete techniques that are very helpful.
For example the [ManyToMany example](https://github.com/payne/Hibernate-SpringBoot/tree/master/HibernateSpringBootManyToManyBidirectional) was easy to get working and explained well in the book.   Since I used that Leonard's repository for the book has been updated -- it's great that it's being updated.  https://github.com/AnghelLeonard/Hibernate-SpringBoot
