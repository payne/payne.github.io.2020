One of the things that struck me as I start to look at the source code that accompanies 
"Murach's Servlets & JSPs" is that it's formatted for netbeans.  It didn't take long to convert one of the 
examples to use maven.  https://github.com/payne/Ch7ex3   

I'm thinking of taking the little I learned doing this, and writing a simple convertor to go from the Murach's 
NetBeans directory structure to something that's more popular in Omaha.  Of course, once you have maven it's quick
to convert to gradle.
