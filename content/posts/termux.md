[TermUX.com] is an android application containing a Linux distro (no X-Windows).   I've installed it
on my ChromeBook via the Play Store.

It's a bit of a pain to get things from termux into the rest of the chromebook.  I like:
1. `python -m http.server`
2.  http://100.115.92.2:8000/   # Note I get the IP # for TermUX using `ifconfig` and looking at the IP for the arc0 interface.
