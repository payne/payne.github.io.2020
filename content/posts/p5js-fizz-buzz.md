# Links and notes from my 3/14/19 talk at [Omaha Ruby & Open Source Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Omaha-Ruby-Meetup/events/xggmrqyzfbsb/)

1. https://github.com/TechOmaha/TechOmaha.Dataset 
2. https://github.com/payne/jQueryBootStrapExaqmple1 simple silly example of consuming the data.  Renders here: http://mattpayne.org/jQueryBootStrapExaqmple1/  I know you can do better!   I challenge you to do better, please!!?!!
3. [The Coding Train](https://www.google.com/search?q=the+coding+train&rlz=1CAHJUL_enUS789US791&oq=the+coding+train&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.2271j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) from NYU!
4. [Programming from A to Z](https://shiffman.net/a2z/) is amazing series on text processing that includes how to implement a Markov Chain (used for predictive completion when sending text messages, etc)
5. http://p5js.org was created by [Lauren McCarthy](http://lauren-mccarthy.com/teaching/p5-js) is amazing, wonderful, and fun.
6. https://editor.p5js.org/ is a free online IDE for writing p5js programs in JavaScript
7. https://editor.p5js.org/payne/sketches/ByzXjdY14 is a nice intro example I like to talk about while lunching with people
8. https://editor.p5js.org/payne/sketches/rkYJAgSpX is the Fizz Buzz Computational "art piece" that I talked about.
9. https://www.manning.com/books/generative-art is one of the books I hope to read someday.

## Thank you for letting me pitch my excitement to you!
