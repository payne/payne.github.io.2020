I fell in love with Chromebooks when I read Kenn White's fantastic July 2017 
article "[My $169 development Chromebook](https://blog.lessonslearned.org/building-a-more-secure-development-chromebook/)."  
Here's a quote of some of his excellent points (please read his whole article):

## "Goals
1. A very modest budget (ideally <$200 USD, all in)
1. 8-10 hour real-world battery life
1. A first-class, local/non-connected dev environment for my current toolchain:
1. go, c/c++, node.js, git, curl, nginx, postgres...
1. Standard network tools (openssl cli, nmap, tcpdump...)
1. Strong hardware-backed verification & mutual auth
1. Open source, actively developed software whenever possible
1. Bonus: secure messaging, voice, video chat, Netflix

## Anti-Features
The finished environment should not:

1. bypass core OS security
1. disable Verified Boot
1. require sudo/root for dev environment
1. rely on Crouton or Ubuntu
1. require (or assume) an always-on network"
