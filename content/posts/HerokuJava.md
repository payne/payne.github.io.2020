HeroKU.com is wonderful for many reasons.  One of which is that you don't need a credit card to get a free account and deploy your application.   

Background:
1. https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/intro-for-java-developers
3. https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/java-webapp-runner
   1. https://github.com/payne/herokuhello is a working example.  I like this technique because it's usuing a normal WAR.  This WAR is run locally by a utility, and run on HeroKU.com via the `Procfile` script.
