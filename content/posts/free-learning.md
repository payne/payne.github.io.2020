I too am a big fan of both 
[FreeCodeCamp.com](https://www.freecodecamp.com) and 
[Lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com).   
The [Computer Science and Software Engineering Theory with Briana](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbmfoj2Th9fvxhHIeqFO7wOy) are fantastic!   I like that they are small and well labeled.  They can be watched in order or you can just jump to what you want to learn.

## Other free learning resources I've seen include:

I'm mostly interested in software development.

[How to teach yourself code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZKvZzRynLE) is a 17 minute interview that contains some wonderful advice.  I have put my notes from this video in a post about [teach yourself code](http://mattpayne.org/learning/2016/09/10/teach-yourself-code.html).
